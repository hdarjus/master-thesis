	\begin{abstract}
		The Chinese financial market is known to be different from the comparably weakly regulated Western markets in many ways.
    One of the symptoms is the unexpected behaviour observed in Chinese common stocks: their returns and changes in their volatility are not negatively correlated.
    It contrasts an intuitive phenomenon called the leverage effect, which has a history going back even to the 1970s, and it is implied by the assumptions in the popular framework of Modigliani and Miller.
    The leverage effect's importance is reflected by the number of time series models that have been developed for its estimation.
    Although most of them are ARCH-type models, we use a promising alternative called the Stochastic Volatility (SV) model with leverage, that has not been applied to Chinese stock datasets yet, and it has better in-sample-fit than its corresponding, similarly sophisticated GARCH models.
    SV is used in this master thesis for the comparison of the leverage effect observed in Chinese and Western markets.
    As the leading economy of the Eurozone, Germany is chosen to represent the latter.
    Our results show the lack of consistent leverage or anti-leverage effect in China altogether, while they confirm the existence of the leverage effect in Germany.
    As a by-product, we find evidence for the stocks having stronger leverage effect through the crisis of 2007.
