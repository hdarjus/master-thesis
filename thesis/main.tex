	\begin{abstract}
		The Chinese financial market is known to be different from the comparably weakly regulated Western markets in many ways. One of the symptoms is the unintuitive behaviour observed on Chinese common stocks: their returns and changes in volatility are not negatively correlated. The widely accepted phenomenon, called the leverage effect after corporates' leverage ratio, has a history going back even to the 1970s when Black noted that a negative return-variance correlation is implied by the assumptions in the popular framework of Modigliani and Miller. The leverage effect's importance is reflected by the number of time series models that have been developed for its estimation. Although most of them are ARCH-type featuring conditionally deterministic variance, there exists a promising alternative that has not been tried on Chinese stock dataset yet, having better in-sample-fit than its corresponding, similarly sophisticated GARCH models. The Stochastic Volatility (SV) model with leverage is used in this master thesis for the comparison of the leverage effect observed in Chinese and Western markets. Germany, being the leading economy of the Eurozone, is chosen to represent the latter. After fitting the SV model to companies of the SSE Index and the DAX Index for several periods in a rolling window fashion, we find that this model confirms the latest results in the literature, namely, the Chinese anti-leverage effect. As a by-product, we also find evidence for the stocks having stronger leverage effect through the crisis of 2007.
