\section{Related work}

Variance of stock returns plays an important role in many fields of finance.
For example, it is crucial in capital asset pricing~\citep{skiadas2009asset}, portfolio management~\citep{chow2014study}, and contingent claim pricing~\citep{hull1987pricing}.
\citeauthor{Christie1982} wrote in 1982 that even though volatility was pivotal in these topics, little work was being done for understanding its properties.

This has changed since 1982.
That year~\citet{Engle1982} introduced the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskestacity (ARCH) model that models non-constant variance conditional on the past.
The ARCH model was later generalised to model volatility more flexibly~\citep{Bollerslev1986}.
Also in 1982, the Stochastic Volatility model was presented in~\citet{Taylor1982}, which models variance as a random process also unconditionally.

It was first described by~\citet{black1976studies}, who proposed two possible explanations.
The first one, and that is probably where the name comes from, was the connection to firms' leverage ratio, i.e. the market equity to debt ratio.
This theory is underlined by the fact that the existence of the leverage effect can be proved in basic structural models of corporate finance, e.g.~\citeauthor{Christie1982} in the Modigliani--Miller world and some of its generalisations.

The effect has been shown using both realised volatility and implied volatility of various models~\citep{Bouchaud2001,Harvey1996,Christie1982,french1987expected}.

The presence of the phenomenon can also be deduced in widely used structural models of corporate finance, e.g. generalisations of Modigliani--Miller~\citep{Christie1982}.
