\section{Model}

Blabla about the model and modelling

\subsection{Formulation}

Original form

Linear form

\subsection{Estimation overview}

blabla

\subsubsection{Frequentist approach}

Maximum likelihood, it doesn't work

\subsubsection{Bayesian approach}

Single move

Multi move, normal estimation

Conditional Gaussian state space form

Matching parameters with papers' models can go to an appendix?
