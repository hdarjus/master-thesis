We compare a number of GARCH and stochastic volatility (SV) models using nine series of oil, petroleum product and natural gas prices in a formal Bayesian model comparison exercise. The competing models include the standard models of GARCH(1,1) and SV with an AR(1) log-volatility process, as well as more flexible models with jumps, volatility in mean, leverage effects, and t distributed and moving average innovations. We find that: (1) SV models generally compare favorably to their GARCH counterparts; (2) the jump component and t distributed innovations substantially improve the performance of the standard GARCH, but are unimportant for the SV model; (3) the volatility feedback channel seems to be superfluous; (4) the moving average component markedly improves the fit of both GARCH and SV models; and (5) the leverage effect is important for modeling crude oil prices-West Texas Intermediate and Brent-but not for other energy prices. Overall, the SV model with moving average innovations is the best model for all nine series.},

The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance terms, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system. Additions to this second edition include the filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian series. Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations. Part II extends the treatment to nonlinear and non-normal models. For these, analytical solutions are not available so methods are based on simulation.},

	abstract = {Simulation smoothing involves drawing state variables (or innovations) in discrete time state-space models from their conditional distribution given parameters and observations. Gaussian simulation smoothing is of particular interest, not only for the direct analysis of Gaussian linear models, but also for the indirect analysis of more general models. Several methods for Gaussian simulation smoothing exist, most of which are based on the Kalman filter. Since states in Gaussian linear statespace models are Gaussian Markov random fields, it is also possible to apply the Cholesky Factor Algorithm (CFA) to draw states. This algorithm takes advantage of the band diagonal structure of the Hessian matrix of the log density to make efficient draws. We show how to exploit the special structure of statespace models to draw latent states even more efficiently. We analyse the computational efficiency of Kalman-filter-based methods, the CFA, and our new method using counts of operations and computational experiments. We show that for many important cases, our method is most efficient. Gains are particularly large for cases where the dimension of observed variables is large or where one makes repeated draws of states for the same parameter values. We apply our method to a multivariate Poisson model with time-varying intensities, which we use to analyse financial market transaction count data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Since the introduction of practical methods for inference in the basic volatility model (J. Business Econom. Statist. 12(4) 371), it has been observed that the basic model is too restrictive for many financial series. We extend the basic SVOL to allow for a so-called "leverage effect" via correlation between the volatility and mean innovations, and for fat-tails in the mean equation innovation. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for the extended volatility model. Thus far, likelihood-based inference for the correlated SVOL model has not appeared in the literature. We develop Bayes Factors to assess the importance of the leverage and fat-tail extensions. Sampling experiments reveal little loss in precision from adding the model extensions but a large loss from using the basic model in the presence of mis-specification. There is overwhelming evidence of a leverage effect for weekly and daily equity indices. The evidence in favor of fat-tails is very strong for daily exchange rate and equity indices, but less so for weekly data. We also find that volatility estimates from the extended model are markedly different from those produced by the basic SVOL. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Choy et al. (2008) studied this model by expressing the bivariate Student-t distribution as a scale mixture of bivariate normal distributions. We propose an alternative formulation by first deriving a conditional Student-t distribution for the return and a marginal Student-t distribution for the log-volatility and then express these two Student-t distributions as a scale mixture of normal (SMN) distributions. Our approach separates the sources of outliers and allows for distinguishing between outliers generated by the return process or by the volatility process, and hence is an improvement over the approach of Choy et al. (2008). In addition, it allows an efficient model implementation using the WinBUGS software. A simulation study is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach and its comparison with the approach by Choy et al. (2008).

In this paper, the SV model based on a conditional normal distribution is compared with SV specifications using conditional heavy-tailed distributions, especially Student's t-distribution and the generalized error distribution. To estimate the SV specifications, a simulated maximum likelihood approach is applied. The results based on daily data on exchange rates and stock returns reveal that the SV model with a conditional normal distribution does not adequately account for the two following empirical facts simultaneously: the leptokurtic distribution of the returns and the low but slowly decaying autocorrelation functions of the squared returns. It is shown that these empirical facts are more adequately captured by an SV model with a conditional heavy-tailed distribution. It also turns out that the choice of the conditional distribution has systematic effects on the parameter estimates of the volatility process.},

The approach relies on the novel idea of approximating the joint distribution of the outcome and volatility innovations by a suitably constructed ten-component mixture of bivariate normal distributions. The resulting posterior distribution is summarized by MCMC methods and the small approximation error in working with the mixture approximation is corrected by a reweighting procedure. The overall procedure is fast and highly efficient. We illustrate the ideas on daily returns of the Tokyo Stock Price Index.

While draws from the posterior utilizing the standard centered parameterization break down when the volatility of volatility parameter in the latent state equation is small, non-centered versions of the model show deficiencies for highly persistent latent variable series. The novel approach of ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving has recently been shown to aid in overcoming these issues for a broad class of multilevel models. It is demonstrated how such an interweaving strategy can be applied to stochastic volatility models in order to greatly improve sampling efficiency for all parameters and throughout the entire parameter range.

	abstract = {An efficient Bayesian estimation using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method is proposed in the case of a multivariate stochastic volatility model as a natural extension of the univariate stochastic volatility model with leverage and heavy-tailed errors. The cross-leverage effects are further incorporated among stock returns. The method is based on a multi-move sampler that samples a block of latent volatility vectors. Its high sampling efficiency is shown using numerical examples in comparison with a single-move sampler that samples one latent volatility vector at a time, given other latent vectors and parameters. To illustrate the proposed method, empirical analyses are provided based on five-dimensional S{\&}P500 sector indices returns. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
